# AI and Machine Learning Training Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is focused on training AI and machine learning models using Python. It covers the full ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The goal is to develop a robust, reusable, and modular ML framework that can be adapted to different datasets and tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 📦 Train/Test split or K-Fold Cross Validation
- 🧠 Model training using scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch
- 📈 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- 💾 Model saving and loading with `joblib`, `pickle`, or model checkpoints
- 📉 Optional: Graphical metrics (matplotlib, seaborn, TensorBoard)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `numpy`, `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - *(Optional)* `tensorflow`, `keras`, `torch`
