# ‚ö° Electricity Usage Analysis per Apartment (July 2025)

This project simulates electricity usage for 20 apartments over a period of 30 days (July 2025). It performs data analysis, anomaly detection, and rich visualizations including 2D, 3D, and heatmaps using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `numpy`.

## üìå Data Generation Details

- **Apartments:** Aot_1 to Aot_20  
- **Dates:** July 1, 2025 to July 30, 2025  
- **Electricity Usage:** Random values from a normal distribution  
  - Mean = 20 kWh  
  - Standard deviation = 5

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations Included

1. **Bar Graph** ‚Äî Total usage per apartment  
2. **Line Plot** ‚Äî Usage comparison  
3. **Histogram** ‚Äî Distribution of electricity usage  
4. **Pie Chart** ‚Äî Share of usage per apartment  
5. **3D Bar Plot** ‚Äî Usage per apartment per day  
6. **Heatmap** ‚Äî Usage pattern over time  
7. **3D Wireframe** ‚Äî Apartment vs Date vs Usage

## üö® Anomaly Detection

- Any reading where usage > `mean + 2*std` is marked as **high usage**
- Such entries are flagged in the dataset with `High_usage_flag = True`
